{"name":"Esp-8266","tagline":"Examples of use of MCU ESP8266 for integration in IoTFrog project","body":"### Welcome to IoTFrog project\r\nThe objecive of this project is study of develop a neuronal IoT network, based on ESP-8266, the main requisites are:\r\n* Easy for end users\r\n* Only need config same domain and password \r\n* Remote managment using web statdard browsed (HTML5, CSS3, javascrit)\r\n* Nothing to intall on remote manager device (Smatphone, PC,...)\r\n* Reply of devices as Html and json\r\n\r\nYou can see our web site on: [using www.IoTfrog.com](https://www.iotfrog.com/)\r\n\r\n### Template of Modules requisites.\r\n**Standar petition:**\r\nAll modules has a web server and they reply to this url \r\n* / -> Reply html form with menu and short descrition\r\n* who -> (Who) reply de the name of device by default ESP-(ID)\r\n* whe -> (Where) Reply where is it\r\n* wha -> (What) Reply a list of orders and descrition of his reply\r\n* sts -> (Status) Reply a list json of the status of sensor and actuattors.\r\n* aba -> (Abaut) Short descrition and links for help and support\r\n* hlp -> (help)  Reply a short guide\r\n* log -> (Loggin) Reply login form (Need for to do changes)\r\n* tre -> (Tree)  Reply description id for build a tree display (treeId, treeParentId, treeclass, and who)\r\n* cfgw -> (Config wifi) send html form for config SIID, Password, IP,Mask, ...\r\n* cfgo -> (Config other) send html form for config especific parameter of module, like email for send alarmas, time values, start stop schendule...\r\n**Specifig module petition**\r\n* mod_xxx ->(Module specific) this is the sintax prefig for petition for set   specific module values.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nmod_led?id=1&val=1 -> call handleLed method for set led 1 on, the reply say {led:1,val=1}\r\nmod_led?id=1&val=0 -> call handleLed method for set led 1 off\r\nmod_led?id=1 -> call handleLed method for get status of led 1, the reply can be {led:1,val=1}\r\nmod_temp?id=1 -> call handleTemp method for get temperature of sensor 1, the reply can be {temp:1,val:27.05,unit:C}\r\n\r\n\r\nset_relay?id=1&val=1 -> call handleRelay method for set relay 1 on\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nNote: All pettition can be asqued as html or json.\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
